# XYZ Molecular Structures

This directory provides the Cartesian coordinates of each molecule from the QUEST database in the standard `.xyz` file format.

- Each molecule is stored in a separate `.xyz` file.
- Files are organized to facilitate direct use in computational chemistry software.

**Note:**  
All geometries are expressed in **atomic units (bohr)**.

These files are intended for practical use in simulations, benchmarks, and computational studies.
