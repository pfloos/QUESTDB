# ðŸ§¬ XYZ Molecular Structures

Welcome to the **XYZ Molecular Structures** directory of the QUEST database!

This folder provides the **Cartesian coordinates** for each molecule in the **standard `.xyz` file format**, ready for use in computational chemistry applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Organization

- Each molecule is stored in a **separate `.xyz` file** for ease of access and automation.
- File names are organized systematically to facilitate **direct integration into quantum chemistry software**.

## âš¡ Important Information

> **Units:**  
> All geometries are expressed in **atomic units (bohr)**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These files are intended to support:
- **Benchmark studies** of excited-state methods
- **Reproducibility** of high-level calculations
- **Simulation setups** for quantum chemical and photochemical research

We recommend using the provided coordinates **without modification** to ensure consistency with the QUEST reference data.
