# Geometries

This directory provides the molecular geometries associated with the QUEST database in two formats:

- The `TeX` directory contains a `.tex` source file and its corresponding `.pdf` document, compiling the Cartesian coordinates of all molecules included in the database for convenient reading and citation.
- The `xyz` directory provides individual `.xyz` files for each system, formatted for direct use in computational chemistry software.

**Note:**  
All Cartesian coordinates are expressed in **atomic units (bohr)**.

For consistency and reproducibility, we recommend using the provided geometries without modification in benchmarking and computational studies.
