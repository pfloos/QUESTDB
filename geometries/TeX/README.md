# ðŸ“„ TeX Molecular Structures

Welcome to the **TeX Molecular Structures** directory of the QUEST database!

This folder provides the **Cartesian coordinates** of all molecules, compiled in a format suitable for documentation, sharing, and citation.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `QUEST-geometries.tex` â€” LaTeX source file containing the full list of molecular geometries.
- `QUEST-geometries.pdf` â€” Human-readable PDF generated from the LaTeX source for easy viewing.

## âš¡ Important Information

> **Units:**  
> All Cartesian coordinates are expressed in **atomic units (bohr)**.
> We provide the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN) for each system, a unique numerical identifier assigned to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature.
> The level of theory used to optimize each geometry is also provided (FC stands for frozen core) 

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These files are designed to support:
- **Convenient visualization** of all molecular structures
- **Documentation** and **archiving** of benchmark geometries
- **Accurate citation** of reference structures in scientific publications
