This directory contains the Cartesian coordinates of all molecules included in the QUEST database, compiled in LaTeX format.

- `quest_structures.tex`: A LaTeX source file listing all molecular geometries.
- `quest_structures.pdf`: A human-readable PDF document generated from the LaTeX source.

**Note:**  
All geometries are expressed in **atomic units (bohr)**.

These files are intended for convenient visualization, documentation, and citation purposes.
