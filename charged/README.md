# âš¡ Charged Excitations of the QUEST Database

This directory gathers high-quality data on **charged excitations** from the **QUEST database**, offering a benchmark for state-of-the-art electronic structure methods.

ðŸ“Œ At this stage, the dataset includes **electron-removal processes** (i.e., ionization potentials). Future updates aim to incorporate **electron-addition transitions** (e.g., electron affinities).

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ”¹ `IPs/`  
**Inner- and Outer-Valence Ionization Potentials & Satellite Transitions**  
Based on the study by [Marie and Loos (2024)](https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00216), this dataset focuses on:
- **58 valence ionization potentials**
- **42 satellite transition energies**
  
Each moleculeâ€™s `.json` file contains:
- Energies computed with a variety of high-level **Green's function** and **wavefunction methods**
- **Spectral weights** for quasiparticle and satellite states
- **TBEs** and **FCI-based uncertainties**
- **Geometries** provided for reproducibility

> ðŸ§ª Ideal for benchmarking **inner- and outer-valence IPs** and validating many-body methods like GW, ADC, CCSD, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ `DIPs/`  
**Valence Double Ionization Potentials (DIPs)**  
From [Marie *et al.* (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0250155), this set includes:
- **Singlet and triplet DIPs** for 23 molecules
- All computed using the **aug-cc-pVTZ** basis

Each `.json` file contains excitation energies obtained with methods like **GW**, **CCSD**, or **CC4**, along with their theoretical rationale.

> ðŸ§¬ Complements the valence IP dataset with challenging **two-electron removal** benchmarks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Purpose

These datasets aim to support:
- Method development and comparison (Greenâ€™s function, EOM, CI, etc.)
- Assessment of **electron correlation**, **satellite states**, and **multielectron processes**
- Construction of **machine learning datasets** for charged excitations
