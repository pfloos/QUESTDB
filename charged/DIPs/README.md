## ðŸ’¥ Double Ionization Potentials (DIPs)

This directory contains the data from [Marie *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0250155) on **singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials (DIPs)** for a set of 23 small molecules, computed using the **aug-cc-pVTZ** basis set.

ðŸ“Œ These molecules are the same as those studied in the [benchmark on valence IPs and satellite transitions](https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00216), ensuring a consistent and complementary dataset.

ðŸ§¬ The molecular **geometries** and **computational methodologies** used here are identical to those employed in the previous benchmark.

This dataset provides a valuable reference for the accurate prediction of **valence DIPs** in both singlet and triplet spin states.
