## 🔍 Inner- and Outer-valence Ionization Potentials & Satellite Transitions

Welcome to the data directory accompanying the study by [Marie and Loos](https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00216), focusing on **valence ionization potentials (IPs)** and **satellite transitions** across a set of 23 representative molecules.

📁 This folder contains:
- **`JSON` files** for each molecule, compiling computational results.
- **Molecular geometries**, provided for completeness and reproducibility.

### 📊 What’s Inside Each `.json` File?

Each file includes:
- **Valence IPs** and **satellite transition energies** (in eV) computed at various levels of theory and with different basis sets.
- **Theoretical best estimates (TBEs)** along with uncertainty estimates based on high-level **FCI** calculations.
- **Spectral weights** associated with **Green's function quasiparticle energies**, helping assess the intensity of each excitation.

In total, the dataset includes:
- **58 valence ionization potentials**
- **42 satellite transition energies**

These data provide a comprehensive benchmark for charged excitations, spanning both inner- and outer-valence electronic structure features.
