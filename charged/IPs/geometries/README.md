## üìê Geometries for Ionization Potential (IP) Calculations

This directory contains the molecular geometries employed in the **ionization potential (IP)** calculations.

- üß¨ Most structures are sourced directly from the original **QUEST** database.  
- ‚ú® A few are **new additions**, tailored for specific benchmarking needs.  
- üìè All geometries are expressed in **angstroms (√Ö)** ‚Äî please take care when using them.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Be sure to verify units and coordinate conventions when integrating with other tools or databases.
