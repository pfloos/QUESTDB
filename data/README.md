# üìä Data Overview

This directory contains the core data from the **QUEST** database.  
It provides highly detailed information for each excited state, including both physical characteristics and computational results.

## üìã Available Information

To assist users in identifying excited states using their preferred methodology, the QUEST database provides the percentage of single excitation involved in the transition (%T‚ÇÅ), oscillator strength $f$, $\langle r^2 \rangle$, and dominant MO contributions for all excited states, computed with reasonably high levels of theory. Additionally, $\langle S^2 \rangle$ values are provided for doublet and quartet states, along with the dominant MO combinations.

## üß† Notes

- All data use **atomic units** unless otherwise specified. Notably, excitation energies are in eV.
- The database is continuously expanded and refined following the "mountaineering strategy" for reaching high-accuracy benchmarks.
