## üìã Available Information

To assist users in identifying excited states using their preferred methodology, the QUEST database provides the percentage of single excitation involved in the transition (%T‚ÇÅ), oscillator strength $f$, the patial extent of the electron cloud $\langle r^2 \rangle$, and dominant MO contributions for all excited states, computed with reasonably high levels of theory. Additionally, $\langle S^2 \rangle$ values are provided for doublet and quartet states, along with the dominant MO combinations.

## üìÇ Files in This Directory

| Filename              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **`QUEST-All.xlsx`**   | Contains all the information listed above for each transition. Each subset described below is presented in a dedicated sheet. |
| **`QUEST-Main.xlsx`**  | Includes all results for relatively compact closed-shell molecules, typically containing 1 to 10 non-hydrogen atoms. |
| **`QUEST-Rad.xlsx`**   | A significant extension of our dataset for small organic and inorganic radicals, now including additional compounds, excited states, and a series of quartet excited states. |
| **`QUEST-Chrom.xlsx`** | Covers excited states of large closed-shell organic chromophores with 10 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms, such as azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. |
| **`QUEST-DNA.xlsx`**   | Presents previously unpublished data for five nucleobases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. |
| **`QUEST-TM.xlsx`**    | Contains results for 11 diatomic molecules featuring one transition metal (Cu, Sc, Ti, or Zn), covering both closed-shell and open-shell cases. |

In addition, `.json` files, gathering the same information, are available for each molecule.

### üßÆ Active Spaces

The folder `cas` contains detailed information on the **active spaces** used in all CASSCF-based calculations. Each entry specifies:

- The number of **active orbitals** per irreducible representation
- The **state-averaging scheme**, including the number of states per symmetry
- Systematic inclusion of the **ground state**, even across symmetries

Proper active space design is key for balancing **electron correlation accuracy** with **computational efficiency**. This metadata ensures full reproducibility and transparency in multiconfigurational treatments.

---

## ü•ó Diet Sets

This directory also includes an example of *diet* subset (located in the `diet` folder), which is carefully designed to reproduce the key statistical features of larger datasets while restricting data size. These size constraints make the subset well-suited for use with computationally demanding or inefficient methods, particularly during the early stages of method development.

The following subset is available:

- **50 excitations** across **20 molecules**: `diet_subset_50.json`  

This set is derived from the QUEST *Main* dataset, excluding unsafe and genuine double excitations (resulting in 824 transitions across 119 molecules). This filtered set of excitations can be found in `filtered_main_set.json`. The corresponding output file (`diet_subset_50.out`) generated using the `quest-diet.py` script is also provided.

> **Note 1:** This *diet* subset is **not unique**. It is generated using a genetic algorithm, which is inherently stochastic ‚Äî meaning that operations like selection, crossover, and mutation involve random choices. As a result, running the `quest-diet.py` script multiple times (even with the same parameters) can produce different subsets of excitations. This variability allows for exploration of multiple near-optimal solutions, but it also means that results are not guaranteed to be reproducible unless a fixed random seed is explicitly set in the script or passed as a parameter.

> **Note 2:** This set was obtained using a genetic algorithm that minimizes a scoring function incorporating the MAE, MSE, and RMSE of single-reference wave function methods. Multireference methods (e.g., CASSCF, CASPT2, and NEVPT2) are excluded. The script can be easily modified to target a different set of methods.

## üß† Notes

- All data use **atomic units** unless otherwise specified. Notably, excitation energies are in eV.
- The database is continuously expanded and refined following the "mountaineering strategy" for reaching high-accuracy benchmarks.
